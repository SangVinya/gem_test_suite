## Example

module Tasks
  def self.math2(x, y)
    s = ((x.abs - y.abs) / (1 + (x * y).abs)).round(4)
    { result: s }
  end
end

TestSuite.hash_has_two_keys?(Tasks.math2(-6.0, -2))

Ð¡onsole output:

Hash has one key
Hash key(s): [:result]

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
